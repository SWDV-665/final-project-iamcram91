    <h2>The RIDGID Store Locator App</h2>
    <p>When running this project, use:ionic serve -l</p>
    <p>
      This project is intended to be designed to have a product page, a store locator page, and a contact page. 
    </p>
    <p>The majority or all of the time for this project has been spent on trying to get stores to be located on a map. 
      Then use the geolcation native plugin to tell users their distance to a store to pick up a RIDGID product. 
    </p>
    <p>While I have not gotten as far as I had hoped on this application yet, the map was recently working and displaying nearby locations</p>
    <p>The native element to the application is working and the markers used on the map add a branded flare.</p>
